# Readme Generator

This program is designed to generate a readme file based off of user input. It comes with the following sections, with which the user can add text to:
>
>- Title
>- Description
>- Installation Instructions
>- Usage Instructions
>- License
>- Badges
>- How to Contribute
>- Tests
>- Questions

The application must be invoked by using the following command: node .\index.js

## What was the motivation?

To further my understanding on how the command line works, and learning how to install and use npm inquirer. The specific version used for this app was inquirer@8.2.4.

This app will also be useful in creating readme files for my future projects/challenges.

## What problems does it solve?

Having to repeatedly format new readme files with titles, licenses, badges, and a table of contents can be tedious. This application serves to automatically create and format a readme with pretty much everything a user needs in it. 

Once the user enters the necessary text to each prompt, a readme file will be generated with all the prompts in the right places, along with a fully functional table of contents. This application is looking to satisfy any user wanting to save time typing up a readme.

## What did you learn?

How the command line works in the terminal. Knowing that you need to be in the directory in your terminal in order to install or execute things that need to be there. Also learnt how to use node to write files with input entered through prompts, as well as knowing how to import a JS library like Inquirer. Knowing that module.exports can export functions so that they can be used in other JS files.
